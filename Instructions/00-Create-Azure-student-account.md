# How to get an Azure for Students account  

If you've never worked with Microsoft Azure before, don’t worry! This guide will walk you through the process of signing up for an **Azure for Students** account, giving you access to free cloud resources to start learning and experimenting.  

To get started, follow these steps:  

1. Open your web browser and go to the [Azure for Students page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/).  
1. Click on the **Start Free** button.  
1. Be sure to **use your Radboud student email address** when creating your account, as this is required for verification.

Microsoft requires you to confirm that you're a student. The verification process is simple:  

1. After signing up, Microsoft will ask you to verify your student status using your school email.  
2. Check your **school email inbox** for a verification email from Microsoft.  
3. Click the verification link in the email to confirm your eligibility.  

Now that your account is ready, you’ll get access to some resources:  

- ✅ **$100 in Azure credits** (valid for 12 months).  
- ✅ **Free access to popular Azure services** like Virtual Machines, AI, Databases, and App Services.  
- ✅ **Free developer tools** such as GitHub Student Developer Pack, Visual Studio Code, and more.  

To begin exploring, go to the **Azure Portal**: [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).

Whenever you sign in to Azure with your Radboud student email, you'll automatically get access to the Azure subscription you just activated.
